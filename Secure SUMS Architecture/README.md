Secure SUMS is the addition of security functions that correspond to the security requirements derived through threat modeling to the existing SUMS. Secure SUMS architecture is drawn through UML. At this time, [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) can be used. The secure SUMS architecture derived by the research team is shown in the picture below.
