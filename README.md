## HASUMS(High-Assurance Software Update Management System)
### Reseach Overview
HASUMS is Secure SUMS developed according to security engineering. The flow of research conducted by this research team to develop this HASUMS is as follows.

1. Identify threats that may occur in SUMS through threat modeling, and derive security requirements to mitigate the threats.
2. Design Secure SUMS by adding security functions corresponding to security requirements through UML.
3. Formally specify Secure SUMS using Event-B.
4. Through Proof Obligation, it is formally verified that the security functions of Secure SUMS do not collide and operate normally.
5. Create source code for Secure SUMS using Atelier B.

The details of the research flow are shown in the picture below.
