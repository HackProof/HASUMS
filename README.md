## HASUMS(High-Assurance Software Update Management System)
### Reseach Overview
HASUMS is Secure SUMS developed according to security engineering. The flow of research conducted by the research team to develop HASUMS is as follows.

- Identify threats that may occur in SUMS through threat modeling, and derive security requirements to mitigate the threats.
- Design Secure SUMS by adding security functions corresponding to security requirements through UML.
- Formally specify Secure SUMS using Event-B.
- Through Proof Obligation, it is formally verified that the security functions of Secure SUMS do not collide and operate normally.
- Automatically generate source code for Secure SUMS using Atelier B.

The details of the research flow are shown in the picture below.
